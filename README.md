# OpenWA Project

Hello there. If you somehow found this repo, through web browsing or researching author profile, than I have nothing for you.
But if you somehow involved into this, I think I need to leave some message here:
To make commit you will need Map and Suffix Applyer (first to sync a workflow). When you finish working, use suffix applyer and create map, UNCHECK ALL CHECKBOXES or else Map applyer might break (And also because in this repository reversing progress title will be updated automaticly and done via check of two maps, so if you add some additional info, hardcoded initial amount of functions counter will break).
You only need to commit to Current Map file, other stuff is only for mine convinience.
